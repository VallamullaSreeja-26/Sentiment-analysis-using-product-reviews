# Sentiment-analysis-using-product-reviews

Sentiment analysis of client product reviews on e-commerce platforms is the goal of this study. Checking through the reviews left by prior buyers of a certain product is one of the key factors that influence customers' decisions to buy. Verifying the correctness of all these assessments and the product's condition is a difficult process. Instead, by categorizing the reviews and purported user opinions into different groups, the revised platforms let prospective purchasers assess the value of the goods by surfacing the product attributes. The goal is to determine if reviews are good, negative, or neutral and to draw conclusions about how customers feel about the items. In order to categorize the evaluations into several emotion categories, the project entails gathering data from an e-commerce site, preparing the data, and using natural language processing algorithms. The sentiment analysis's findings may aid companies in understanding client feedback, pinpointing areas for development, and making data-driven decisions to improve their goods and services.
